# public_ParticularMatter

A public, educational release of the **Particular Matter ESP8266 firmware**. This repository demonstrates the structure and build process of the firmware while keeping all private backend and credential logic hidden.

The project includes both:
- a **fully functional compiled firmware** (`firmware.bin`) ready to be installed on an ESP8266 device using **ESPHome**, and
- an **educational, non‑functional C++ source** (`ParticularMatter_public.cpp`) that documents the firmware architecture, logic flow, and key implementation concepts.

## 🚀 Installation with ESPHome

The `firmware.bin` file inside `src/build/esp8266/` is a **ready‑to‑use firmware** image compiled for ESP8266 boards (e.g., Feather HUZZAH, NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini).

### Requirements
- [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) (CLI or Home Assistant integration)
- An ESP8266 device
- A USB cable for flashing

### Flash using ESPHome CLI

1. Connect your ESP8266 board to your computer.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   esphome run src/build/esp8266/firmware.bin
   ```

   or, to upload manually:

   ```bash
   esphome upload src/build/esp8266/firmware.bin
   ```

   You can also flash via the ESPHome dashboard in Home Assistant.

After installation, the device will boot and start the firmware’s normal operation — setting up an access point, hosting a configuration page, and reading PMS5003 data.

## 🧠 About the educational source (`ParticularMatter_public.cpp`)

The file `src/cpp/ParticularMatter_public.cpp` is a **redacted, non‑functional** version of the actual firmware used internally by Particular Matter. It is included for transparency and educational purposes.

It demonstrates how the full firmware:
- Brings up an **Access Point + Captive Portal** for first‑time setup
- Hosts a **Web UI** to collect Wi‑Fi credentials and device info
- Stores configuration safely in **EEPROM**
- Reads **PMS5003 particulate matter sensor** data via SoftwareSerial
- Performs **device registration and MQTT publishing** (stubbed in this public version)
- Implements **robust logging and memory management** for ESP8266 devices

This version is ideal for:
- Understanding the firmware design
- Learning about Wi‑Fi AP setup, EEPROM storage, JSON parsing, and MQTT flow
- Adapting the structure for your own projects

> ⚠️ The educational firmware does not connect to any backend or broker. All sensitive constants, URLs, and tokens have been removed.

## 🔧 Adapting for private or research use

If you intend to rebuild the firmware using the educational source:
1. Define your own backend and MQTT credentials in a private header (e.g., `backend_config.h`).
2. Replace the stubbed HTTPS registration and MQTT routines with your own logic.
3. Recompile using **PlatformIO** or **Arduino CLI** with ESP8266 Core ≥ 3.x.

## ⚙️ Build Environment

The project is designed for:
- **Board**: ESP8266 (Feather HUZZAH / NodeMCU / Wemos D1 Mini)
- **Core**: ESP8266 Arduino Core 3.x (compatible with 2.7+)
- **Dependencies**:
  - `ESP8266WiFi`
  - `ESP8266WebServer`
  - `DNSServer`
  - `EEPROM`
  - `ArduinoJson`
  - `SoftwareSerial`
  - *(optional)* `ESP8266HTTPClient`, `PubSubClient`

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- This public release **does not** contain any private API endpoints or certificates.
- The functional firmware (`firmware.bin`) uses generic placeholder behavior suitable for demonstration.
- Always protect production firmware with proper TLS and credential storage.
